Day 11/120 – Charts

Still on the guided video I’ve been following, today was all about charts. I’m getting more comfortable with Excel.

I learned how choosing the right chart depends on the question you’re trying to answer.

Line charts → trends over time.
Pie charts → proportions (best with 3–4 categories).
Column & Bar charts → comparing categories (vertical vs horizontal).

I also learned I can control what shows on a chart — adjusting axes, labels, and data selection instead of accepting the default.

Explored more advanced visuals too:
• Scatterplots → relationship between two numbers
• Map charts → data by location
• Histograms → distribution using bins
• Box & Whisker → spread, median & quartiles
• Sparklines → mini charts inside a cell

Some were easy. Some took a minute to really understand.

I’m realizing charts are less about design and more about clarity.
