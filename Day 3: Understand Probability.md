Day 3 of my 120-Day Data Analytics Challenge: Understanding Probability

Today I explored correlation and probability. Probability is just a way to measure how likely something is — between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain).

We use it all the time without noticing: in weather forecasts, lottery tickets, sports predictions, and delivery estimates.

I also learned about some types of probability distribution:

* Discrete → outcomes you can count

* Continuous → outcomes you measure

I also learned about some common distributions:

* Normal (bell curve) → common in real-world data

* Uniform → every outcome equally likely (like rolling a die)

* Poisson → predicts rare events over time

* Exponential → estimates waiting times

Today helped me see how probability can be a practical tool in understanding data. The challenging part is learning how to recognize when each distribution applies,
but I can feel that this stage is laying the groundwork I will rely on later.
