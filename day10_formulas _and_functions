Day 10/120 – Arrays, Lookups & Dates

Today I went deeper into classic and modern (dynamic) arrays. Writing one formula and watching it spill into other cells is still fascinating.

I practiced UNIQUE, SORT, and SUMPRODUCT, and used MEDIAN with an IF array to analyze salaries.

Worked more with VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and XLOOKUP — starting to see when each makes sense.

Text functions were my favorite. I combined columns with TEXTJOIN and had to research an alternative to TEXTSPLIT since my Excel version doesn’t have it.

Wrapped up with date and time functions like DAY, MONTH, YEAR, HOUR, and DATE to clean datetime data.

Still stretching, but it’s slowly making sense.
