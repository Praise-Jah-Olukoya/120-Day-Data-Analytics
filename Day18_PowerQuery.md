I’ve come across Power Query before, but today felt different.
If Excel is the table where analysis results are presented, then Power Query is the kitchen where data preparation happens first.
It is the space where data is connected, shaped, and transformed before it reaches the spreadsheet.
Power Query helps reduce the amount of manual work that would normally be done using formulas and functions. 
Exploring it today helped me understand how data preparation can be more structured and automated.

The Power Query Editor felt like stepping into a behind-the-scenes workspace. 
Every action I performed was recorded in Applied Steps. It felt like a recorder capturing my entire cleaning and transformation process. 
I could rename each step to keep track of what I had done.

I also practiced cleaning data using features such as Replace Values, adding new columns, and checking data quality indicators. 
The green bar just below the column headers shows the proportion of valid data in a column.

Another thing that became clearer to me today was the difference in workflow choices.

Using a feature in the Transform tab modifies values directly in the selected column, while using the same feature in the Add Column tab 
creates a new column. It’s a small difference, but it helps you decide how to structure your data.

I am starting to appreciate how Power Query helps make data preparation faster and easier.
