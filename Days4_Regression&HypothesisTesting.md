Diving into hypothesis testing and regression opened a new perspective on how data can tell a story.

Hypothesis testing begins with two parts:
The null hypothesis (no effect, no relationship) and the alternative hypothesis (there is an effect or relationship).

The process itself stood out — setting the hypothesis, collecting data, choosing a significance level, and then running tests like t-tests or chi-square 
to see what the data says. It made the whole idea feel more structured and less abstract.

Regression analysis focuses on understanding relationships between variables and using them to make predictions.
Simple linear regression looks at two variables, while multiple regression involves more than one independent variable.
The “line of best fit” concept made it easier to visualize what’s happening within the data.

Statistics is starting to feel less like a collection of formulas and more like a way of thinking. It requires asking clear questions
and looking for patterns instead of relying on assumptions. I’m curious to see how confident I’ll feel applying this to a real dataset.
