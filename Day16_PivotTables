## Day 16/120 — Pivot Tables

Day 16/120 of learning data analytics in public and today was all about Pivot Tables.

If you've ever stared at a large dataset wondering how to make sense of it all — Pivot Tables are exactly what you need. 
You drag and drop fields and Excel organizes and summarizes everything for you instantly.

I explored:
- The PivotTable Analyze tab which is basically the control center for managing your table
- Grouping, hierarchy and advanced features
- Pivot Charts, Slicers and Timelines to filter and visualize data interactively

The part that impressed me most was connecting slicers and timelines to multiple charts so one click filters everything at once. That's what makes a dashboard feel alive.

Grouping is the one thing that didn't fully click today. I'm putting it on my list to revisit.

Pivot Tables actually made a lot of sense to me overall — more than I expected going in.
