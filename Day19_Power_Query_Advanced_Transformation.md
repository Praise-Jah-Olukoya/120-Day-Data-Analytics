## Day 19/120 — Power Query: Advanced Transformations

Day 19 was back in Power Query, going deeper.

Today was advanced transformations and there was a lot to work through. Here's what I covered:

- Added an index column to keep track of row order in a dataset.

- Learned the difference between Duplicate and Reference Query. Duplicating creates an independent copy — changes to the original don't carry through. Referencing stays connected — update the original and it flows through automatically. That one stuck with me.

- Practiced splitting columns, unpivoting data and cleaning up whitespaces with Trim.

- Explored Group By, Conditional Column and the difference between Append and Merge. Append stacks tables on top of each other. Merge joins them side by side based on a matching column.

- Went through the 6 types of joins. Left, Right and Inner Join made sense. The other three still need more time.

- Got introduced to M language — the scripting language behind every Power Query transformation. Honestly? It went over my head. I know it exists and that's where I'm leaving it for now.

19 days in and I'm realizing that learning data analytics isn't about mastering everything at once. It's about building understanding one concept at a time.
