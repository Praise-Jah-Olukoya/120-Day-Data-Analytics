Today I learned that time series analysis is about understanding data over time — not just what happened,
but how things change and repeat.
Breaking it into components made it clearer for me:
Trend (overall direction),
Seasonality (repeated patterns),
Cyclic patterns (longer-term rises and falls),
Noise (random fluctuations).
Seeing it this way made it less overwhelming.
I was also introduced to forecasting models like moving averages, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA. 
I don’t fully understand them yet, but I can see how they help turn past patterns into more informed projections.
I’m realizing analysis isn’t just about numbers — timing matters too. 
Still learning, but I’m beginning to understand how much impact timing has in data analysis.
