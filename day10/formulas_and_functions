Day 10/120 – Arrays, Lookups & Text

Today I went deeper into classic and modern (dynamic) arrays while following a guided YouTube video by Luke Barousse.

Classic arrays apply one formula across a selected range.
Dynamic arrays let one formula spill results automatically into other cells.

I also practiced VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and XLOOKUP to return related values from tables instead of hard coding.

Text functions were my favorite. My Excel version doesn’t have TEXTSPLIT, so I researched an alternative and used Text to Columns to split full names.

Still stretching, but it’s starting to connect.
