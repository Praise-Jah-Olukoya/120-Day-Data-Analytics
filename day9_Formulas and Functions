Day 9/120 – Formulas & Functions

Today felt like a lot.

I practiced writing formulas in Excel using basic math operators and learned how order of operations affects results.
Comparison operators (=, >, <, etc.) are starting to make more sense too.

Cell referencing finally clicked:
Absolute ($A$1) locks everything.
Mixed (A$1 or $A1) locks part of it.
And pressing F4 cycles through the reference types — which makes it much easier.

I explored functions like SUM, AVERAGE, COUNTIF, IF, AND, OR, and even touched statistical ones like median and quartiles.

It’s a lot to process, but I’m beginning to see how functions help you ask better questions from data.
