## Day 17/120

Today was a bit overwhelming. We covered a lot at once, and I’m still sitting with some of the ideas, especially how forecasting works behind the scenes.

We explored another side of Excel:

• Add-ins are extra tools you can plug into Excel to expand what it can do beyond the default features.
• Forecast Sheet uses existing data to predict possible future trends. I understand what it does, but the logic behind it is still something I’m unpacking.
• What-If Analysis introduced Data Tables, Goal Seek, and Scenario Manager — tools for decision modeling.
• The Toolpak impressed me the most. You can run a variety of statistical tests — regression, sampling, variance, and more — without writing formulas.

Learning in layers. One day at a time.
